# Advanced Computer Vision Techniques

## Description

This repository showcases the implementation of two computer vision techniques: a Denoising Autoencoder and a Region Proposal Network (RPN). These Jupyter notebooks provide a deep dive into the mechanisms behind image denoising and efficient object detection, demonstrating the power and versatility of deep learning in image processing tasks.

## Notebooks Overview

- **DenoisingAutoEncoder.ipynb**: Offers a deep dive into the design, implementation, and training of a Denoising Autoencoder. It emphasizes the use of TensorBoard for tracking model performance, featuring a comprehensive guide on interpreting loss graphs and adjusting model parameters for optimal denoising results.

- **RPN_Implementation.ipynb**: Provides a step-by-step tutorial on building a Region Proposal Network from the ground up. This notebook covers everything from data preprocessing to model training on a sample dataset, elucidating the practical aspects of developing effective object detection systems.

## Key Features

- **In-depth Tutorials**: Each notebook serves as a detailed tutorial, walking through the theory and practice of constructing and training deep learning models in computer vision.
- **Performance Tracking**: Demonstrates the application of TensorBoard for real-time tracking of model performance, with guidance on how to leverage visual data for model improvement.
